# Chat-with-csv
Query your CSV files using chat-GPT or Google PaLM. I created this app to demo my work on Microsoft's Semantic Kernel. I implemented the Google PaLM connector and data querying skill. It is not part of the released package, this project uses a branch on my fork instead of the official Semantic Kernel package.

# Usage
- Visit https://query-csv.streamlit.app/
- Choose which LLM to use and enter your API key
- Upload your CSV
- Ask anything about your data

# Interface
